# Mindathe Irikk üéØ


## Basic Details

### Team Name: Masala Dosa


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sebin Thomas - SOE, CUSAT
- Member 2: Keerthana D S - SOE, CUSAT

### Project Description
Mindathe Irikk is your unapologetically sassy Mallu sound guardian for movie nights. Using voice detection, it monitors your noise levels ‚Äî and the moment you get too loud, it doesn‚Äôt hold back. From sarcastic remarks to full-on scoldings, it channels the spirit of a strict roaster right into your browser. Totally unnecessary. Deeply unasked for. And yet... absolutely iconic.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People talk. People munch. People ruin movies with their noise.
There‚Äôs no system that tells them to shut up‚Ä¶ politely. Or not-so-politely.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We strapped a mic to your screen and gave it attitude.
Mindathe Irikk is a chrome extension that listens in, and if you talk over the movie, it gives you an earful ‚Äì scolding you in true Kerala-style audio warnings.
